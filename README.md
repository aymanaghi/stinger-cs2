# Stinger's CS2 Training OS  
### Helping players get better — including myself  

> “Chaos in code, order in games.”

I’m not a pro.  
I’m a **Dota 2 addict**, **Linux tinkerer**, and **CS2 grinder** trying to level up — while building tools to help others do the same.

This repo is **my public training journal**:  
- What I practice  
- What I break  
- What actually moves the needle  

If it helps **one other player** avoid my mistakes or find their rhythm… it’s worth it.

## 🧠 Core Beliefs
- **Improvement > perfection**  
- **Deliberate practice beats mindless play**  
- **Share openly — we rise together**

---

## 🗂️ What’s Inside
- `configs/` → My real CS2 settings (G305, 400 DPI, green dot)  
- `drills/` → 10–15 min daily routines (aim, movement, utility)  
- `mindset/` → Tilt resets, focus rituals, post-game reviews  
- `maps/` → Lineups I’ve tested (and died for)  
- `tools/` → Scripts to analyze demos, track progress (Python + chaos)

---

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Stop overpeeking B site  
- Master AWP flicks on Inferno  
- Build a demo analyzer that tells me *why* I died  

---

## 🤝 Want to grow together?
- **Use this** — steal what helps you  
- **Contribute** — fix mistakes, add drills, share your config  
- **DM me** — if you’re grinding ranked and need a practice partner
