# CS2 Pro Player "Commands"  
### by [Ayman](https://github.com/aymanaghi) — *Code by day, gamer by night*

> “Chaos in code, order in games.”  
> “I break things just to build them better.”  

This is my **training OS** — a personal system to bring structure to CS2 while the rest of my life is a Fedora/Arch experiment.

I’m not a pro (yet).  
But I’m **spiritual waking up**, **trying to figure it out**, and **fragging harder every day**.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `configs/` → My actual CS2 config (G305, 400 DPI, green dot)
- `drills/` → 15-min daily routines that fix real weaknesses
- `mindset/` → Tilt control, focus, and post-rage-quit rituals
- `maps/` → Lineups I’ve tested (not copied from YouTube)
- `tools/` → Scripts to parse demos, track progress (Python + chaos)

## 🎯 Current Grind
- Stop overpeeking B site on Mirage  
- Master 3 AWP flicks on Inferno  
- Build a demo analyzer that tells me *why* I died
