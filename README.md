.# Stinger's CS2 Training OS  
### Code by day, gamer by night • Chaos in code, order in games

I’m not a pro.  
But I’m **spiritual waking up**, **trying to figure it out**, and building a **personal system** to train smarter — not just play more.

This is my **CS2 lab**: configs, drills, mindset resets, and tools I actually use.  
No fluff. No copied YouTube lineups. Just real work.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

- `configs/` → My real `autoexec.cfg` (G305, 400 DPI, green dot)  
- `drills/` → 15-min daily routines that fix actual weaknesses  
- `mindset/` → Tilt control, focus, and post-rage rituals  
- `maps/` → Lineups I’ve tested (and died for)  
- `tools/` → Scripts to parse demos, track progress (Python + chaos)

---

## 🎯 Current Grind
- Stop overpeeking B site on Mirage  
- Master 3 AWP flicks on Inferno  
- Build a demo analyzer that tells me *why* I died
